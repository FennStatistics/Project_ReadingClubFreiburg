# Reading Club Freiburg

## Description

**Core idea**: We thought about a reading club, which will meet every 1-2 weeks. The idea is to read a chapter of a methodological book beforehand and discuss it together. If someone has time, a single person could prepare a mini summary / R code / few slides to repeat the content of the respective chapter. Please participate in the small survey (see below).
